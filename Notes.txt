instructions for setting up Digitimer and matlab:
https://www.digitimer.com/matlab-control-of-ds8r-stimulator/
-Digitimer DS8R Virtual Front Panel Software Installer (supplied with DS8R).
-Digitimer DS8R Matlab Solution ZIP file, including the DS8R Proxy DLL installer.
-Base Matlab package, including a third-party compiler(MinGW-w64).
-I had to install the MinGW-w64 compiler, by: 
MATLAB Home tab, in the Environment section, click Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons

Johannes protocol:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The stimulus intensity is increased in 2 mA steps starting at 1 mA. When a successful muscle
% response is recorded (i.e., a Z-score > 12), the intensity is decreased with steps of 1 mA until the
% muscle response disappeares. The stimulus intensity is then increased with increments of 0.5 mA
% until a second successful muscle response is recorded. Then, the intensity is decreased with steps
% of 0.5 mA until the response disappeares. The intensity is again increased with steps of 0.5 mA
% until a third muscle response appears. The mean value of the stimulus intensities eliciting the three
% successful muscle reflex responses is calculated and used as the NWR threshold. The stimulation
% procedure continues either until three successful muscle reflex responses are detected, until the
% stimulus intensity reached max mA, or until the subject asks to stop
